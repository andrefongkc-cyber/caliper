Status: feature_point + nearest_feature done locally on stream/core/feature-queries; 3 shell tests assert they're missing, next: agree the test change with Lucas, then dimension_value

# Core workplan — Stream A

Owns `caliper/engine/`, `bench/`, `tests/` (except `tests/app/`), and this file. `caliper/contracts/` changes go through a joint PR once frozen (after Phase 0.5).

Markers: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## Phase 0 — Foundation (single session, before the streams split)

Steps are numbered 1–8 to avoid confusion with Phase 0.5, the milestone spike.

- [x] Step 1: Architecture review. Decisions agreed; recorded as ADRs 0001–0006 in step 4
- [x] Step 2: Scaffold
  - [x] git repo, `main` + `phase-0/foundation` branch
  - [x] `pyproject.toml` (uv; extras `app` = pyside6-essentials, `occt`; groups `dev`, `app-test`), `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `.python-version` 3.13
  - [x] ruff (incl. GPL-only Qt module ban), mypy strict on contracts + engine
  - [x] Import-boundary test (invariants 1 and 7, contracts stdlib-only); verified it fails on violations
  - [x] CI: `core.yml` (Linux, every PR) + `app.yml` (macOS, main + shell-affecting PRs). Not yet run on GitHub: no remote
- [x] Step 3: `contracts/`. All ten decisions approved by the user (2026-09-14)
  - [x] `errors.py` (ErrorCode, Error), `document.py`, `queries.py`, `commands.py`, `kernel.py` (Provisional); mypy strict clean
  - [x] `tests/contracts/test_contracts.py`: frozen/slots/kw_only, unique kinds, create commands mirror entities, ModifyEntity covers every field
  - [x] ADR 0002 (command bus, deltas, undo) and ADR 0005 (file format)
- [x] Step 4: Collaboration setup + docs (branch protection waits for the remote)
  - [x] CI boundary check: stream branches may only touch their own areas (`tests/app/` belongs to Stream B)
  - [x] Dependency license test + `licenses` workflow (ADR 0006)
  - [x] `.github/CODEOWNERS` with placeholder usernames (user fills in before the first PR)
  - [x] ADRs 0001, 0003 (Proposed), 0004, 0006
  - [x] architecture.md, vision.md, CLAUDE.md (+ nested engine/app), README, CONTRIBUTING (incl. branch protection settings)
- [x] Step 5: `FakeKernel` + shared kernel conformance suite
  - [x] `caliper/engine/geometry/fake_kernel.py`: analytic Rectangle/Circle faces; mypy strict clean
  - [x] `tests/engine/geometry/test_kernel_conformance.py`: hypothesis property tests with size-scaled tolerances; OCCT cases skip until OCCTKernel exists. Verified it fails on a wrong formula and a 10 µm bbox error
  - [x] `tests/conftest.py`: hypothesis `ci` profile (derandomized) when `CI` is set
- [x] Step 6: Headless vertical slice: the milestone without UI (create 100×50 → width 120 → save → load → replay byte-identical)
  - [x] `engine/document/delta.py`: diff + checked apply (stale deltas fail loudly)
  - [x] `engine/commands/validation.py` + `handlers.py`: all create commands and ModifyEntity; Move/Delete raise NotImplementedError until V1
  - [x] `engine/commands/bus.py`: execute, undo/redo (bounded by count), labels, subscribe; transactions/merge_key/queries raise NotImplementedError until V1
  - [x] `engine/io/`: canonical JSON (strict parse), structural codec, snapshot save (atomic)/load with validation + migration chain, command scripts
  - [x] `python -m caliper.engine replay` + committed golden file compared on Linux and macOS CI; `.gitattributes` keeps files LF
- [x] Rewrite Part 2 / Part 3 kickoff prompts → `docs/kickoff/stream-a-core.md`, `docs/kickoff/stream-b-shell.md`
- [x] Step 7: Bench stub: `bench/run.py` + cases `rectangle-100x50`, `resize-width-120`
  - [x] Reference solver, byte-exact snapshot comparison; expectations report "pending" until queries land (V1)
  - [x] `tests/test_bench.py` confirms wrong results and rejected solutions fail
- [x] Step 8: Check in with the user, then open PR `phase-0/foundation` → `main`
  - [x] CODEOWNERS: Stream A @andrefongkc-cyber, Stream B @lucassnam
  - [x] `app (macOS)` runs on every PR and is a required check (public repo: macOS runners are free)
  - [x] Rewrote all 31 commits to the GitHub no-reply address (trees and dates unchanged); repo-local `user.email` set
  - [x] Installed `gh` 2.100.0 (checksum verified); user signed in via device flow (scopes repo, workflow)
  - [x] Created empty public repo https://github.com/andrefongkc-cyber/caliper; `origin` set; invited @lucassnam (write)
  - [x] Pushed `main` and `phase-0/foundation`
  - [x] Branch protection on `main`: 1 approval + code owners, stale approvals dismissed, required checks `core (Linux)` / `app (macOS)` / `boundaries` (strict), linear history, admins included
  - [x] Opened https://github.com/andrefongkc-cyber/caliper/pull/1; fixed CI setup (pinned setup-uv to a commit, disabled pytest-qt in the licenses job). All four checks green
  - [x] Lucas approved and merged PR #1 (2026-09-15) as a squash: one commit `9c7b5ee`, tree identical to `phase-0/foundation`. Future PRs use "Rebase and merge"

## Phase 0.5 — Milestone spike (4-day timebox; shell side in shell.md)

- [x] planegcs build test on Apple Silicon (2026-09-15). ADR 0003 steps 1–3 pass; proposing Accepted (maintainers edit the ADR)
  - Setup: Xcode 26.6 / Apple clang 21, Homebrew `eigen@3` 3.4.1 + `boost` 1.92.0 (header-only use). CMake 4.4.3 and pybind11 3.1.0 come from PyPI via scikit-build-core
  - Build: `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/eigen@3;/opt/homebrew/opt/boost" uv pip install --no-binary planegcs planegcs==0.8.0` on Python 3.13: 15 s, no errors. Upstream suite: 227 passed, 1 skipped
  - Solve: 4 lines + 4 coincident + H/V + width/height distances + fixed corner → DOF 0, no conflicts/redundancy, exact (0,0)–(100,50); 5 re-solves and a fresh build are bit-identical; width 100→120 re-solves to (120,50). Unfixed (DOF 2) also converges, but a width change moves both sides, so V1.5 must pin what stays put. Over-constraint is reported as conflicting
  - Wheel: `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0 uv build --wheel` gives `macosx_14_0_arm64`, links only libc++/libSystem (self-contained). Default target is the host OS (26.0), so CI must set it. Step 4 (cibuildwheel in CI) not run: needs a `.github/` workflow, to propose on a `shared/` branch
- [ ] Verify `pyside6-essentials` contains no GPL-only modules (ADR 0006)
- [x] `Queries` for the spike: `caliper/engine/queries.py` (`DocumentQueries`), returned by `bus.queries`
  - `bounding_box` and `entity_at_point` for line, circle, arc, rectangle; other methods `NotImplementedError`
  - Hit-testing measures distance to the outline (a rectangle's interior misses); arcs use endpoints + axis crossings for tight bounds
  - Bench marks each unimplemented `check` as pending; both cases still pass with 2 pending expectations each
  - Tests: `tests/engine/test_queries.py` (unit + hypothesis: tight arc bounds, translation, edge hits); verified they fail on a dropped axis crossing and on interior hits
- [~] Contract gaps the spike surfaces (engine side so far; Lucas adds the shell side). For the freeze PR:
  1. `entity_at_point` / `nearest_feature` / `entities_in_box` can't return `Error`, so invalid input (NaN point, negative tolerance, inverted box) has no way to say so. Engine returns "no match" for now. Decide: add `| Error`, or document "invalid input matches nothing"
  2. `entity_at_point` doesn't say outline vs interior. Engine uses the outline; the docstring should say so
  3. "Ties broken by id" is string order, so `e10` sorts before `e2`. Say so explicitly
  4. `bounding_box` doesn't specify: a document with no geometry (engine: `SELECTION_EMPTY`), an annotation id (engine: `ENTITY_WRONG_KIND`), duplicate ids (engine: allowed). `Error.field` is `"ids"` with no index
  5. Bounds exclude annotations, so zoom-to-fit clips dimension text unless the shell adds label extents
  6. `nearest_feature` doesn't say how ties break or what distance means. Engine: distance to feature points (not outlines), ties to the lower entity id (the shell's test fake agrees)
- [x] PR #2 merged 2026-09-15 (Lucas, squashed into `7ac0543`); PR #3 (milestone + V1 shell) rebase-merged the same day. Tests on `main` with the app extra: 293 passed
- [x] PR #4 (PR summary template, "Rebase and merge" rule) rebase-merged 2026-09-15 as `88a23df`. Deleted the old `stream/core` branch (local and remote; its content is `7ac0543` on main). Stream A now works on `stream/core/<topic>` branches
- [ ] Engine pieces the shell already calls through `caliper/app/engine_gaps.py`, in its order (shell.md):
  - [~] `feature_point` + `nearest_feature` (snapping, dimension tool, drawing distance dimensions). Branch `stream/core/feature-queries`, not pushed
    - Engine side done: every POINT_FEATURES entry for all four types (arc points exact at multiples of 90°); bad refs reuse the command validator's errors (`ref.entity` / `ref.feature`); tests include a hypothesis round-trip (arc feature → snap → same point, on the arc), verified to fail on a wrong arc mid, a reversed tie-break, and a wrong rectangle center
    - Blocked on Stream B: `tests/app/test_canvas.py` has 3 tests that assert these queries are missing (`test_paints_every_entity_kind` expects 1 hidden dimension, `test_without_point_queries_the_pointer_snaps_to_the_grid`, `test_dimension_tool_reports_missing_point_picking`). They fail on this branch, and `app (macOS)` is required. `CompletedQueries` in `tests/app/conftest.py` can drop its two stand-ins once this lands
  - [ ] `dimension_value` (dimension labels show "?")
  - [ ] `MoveEntities`, `DeleteEntities` (cascade to dimensions)
  - [ ] `entities_in_box` (box selection)
  - [ ] `check` for bbox metrics, so the bench cases stop showing pending
- [ ] Exit: milestone works end to end → freeze `commands.py` + `document.py` → split streams

## V1 — Core

- [ ] Document model: entities, IDs, dirty tracking (no spatial index; revisit at >2,000 entities or hit-testing in a profile)
- [ ] Commands: create/move/delete line, circle, rectangle, arc; modify dimension; compound
- [ ] Command bus: validation, execution, automatic deltas, batch transactions, unrecorded mode
- [ ] Undo/redo: bounded stack (count + bytes), display labels
- [ ] `OCCTKernel` behind the `occt` extra; passes the shared conformance suite
- [ ] Serialization: snapshot save/load, schema version, migration framework, history section off by default + stripped on export
- [ ] Query API: `measure_distance`, `bounding_box`, `entity_at_point`, `mass_properties`
- [ ] CLI: `python -m caliper.engine replay | inspect | export`
- [ ] Property-based tests on geometry invariants
- [ ] Bench cases as features land
